# trackerApp
Scouting app for FIRST robotics, meant to be either a standalone application you can use to scout on a computer or a base you can use to make your own.

**Standalone Executable**

**How does it work?**
This project takes user input from the display and writes it to a CSV with the number of the robot. The display then can read it, sort the files, and compare them. This is not a fully developed program, but it does a decent job at what it's meant to do. To be honest, it's not much better than pen and paper, but for me this was more of a learning experience and it might help you too. 

Source code is built in IntelliJ, using JFrame and custom data management.
This project COULD be improved, but I am too lazy to optimize it... :P
Feel free to use parts or all of this project for something similar or completely different. 
I will fix bugs if they come up
